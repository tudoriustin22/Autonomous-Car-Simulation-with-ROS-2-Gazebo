# Autonomous Car Simulation with ROS 2 & Gazebo

A lightweight and modular autonomous driving simulator built with ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo Classic, focused on vision-based lane detection and manual teleoperation. Designed for efficient simulation and testing on machines with limited resources.

## üöó Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a modular autonomous driving system with the following core features:

- 3D simulation environment with custom roads and signs.
- A Prius vehicle model with Ackerman steering and onboard camera.
- Vision-based lane detection using traditional computer vision techniques.
- Manual and autonomous control modes.
- Modular ROS 2 architecture for scalable and testable development.
